# Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech (June 2025)** under the Data Science domain.

### 📌 Objective:
Build a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the target variable based on input features.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

### 🔎 Steps:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Splitting data (Train/Test)
- Model training using `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- Evaluation with accuracy & confusion matrix

### ✅ Outcome:
Achieved a good accuracy with clear model interpretation.  
Decision Trees are easy to visualize and great for classification tasks.
